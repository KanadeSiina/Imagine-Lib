## Project Introduction

A simple try for vue as well as a homework for SQL(2).

You can find our back-end [here](https://github.com/Rickenqi/library).

When running on localhost, this front-end will run on port 8081, while the back-end will run on port 8080.

The project use webpack to avoid CORS. If you would like to set it up to a production environment, the config must be changed and something like nginx should be used to avoid CORS.
